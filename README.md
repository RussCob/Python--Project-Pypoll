# Overview 

* In this Project, I created a Python script for analyzing the votes of election result of PyPoll.

* We have a dataset and the dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast,

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes,

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
  * Also, final script both print the analysis to the terminal and exporting a text file with the results.

* Final analysis:
